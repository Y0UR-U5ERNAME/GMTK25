IDEAS
- player has to replay the same level over and over again but changes slightly each time
- player has to act like the enemies and move in the same path to not be spotted, in a loop
- player has to complete the loop (circuits/code?)
- make enemies go in a loop by changing their code
- player has to find a loop and break it
- player has to replay over and over until nails down the things that happen each time
- roguelike but ...
- player can reset to point in time to get upgrades
- not allowed to repeat yourself
- everything repeats except one difference player has to spot
- player has to repeat self as closely as possible
- player returns to same room over and over until finds way to break loop
- replay same level until something happens
- simon says but have to choose own loop and cant repeat self
- pokemon ranger? make loops around things to capture
- player makes time loop between two points in time
- piano playing? while having to play two hands looping the same notes in different times, syncing loops
- manually controlling a clock (two hands)
- planet orbits (prevent/make two planets crash into each other)
- player has to continue doing same actions (job) while trying to do something else (playing game?), has to keep playing game to keep up energy to do job. money from job can be used on upgrades that help do job/play game better. work until get promotion and job can change. boss comes to check on certain levels. there might be slight hiccups during job (light goes out?). products made by player in previous level reappear in later levels?
- player replays but has to copy previous playthrough's path as closely as possible. 

CHOSEN IDEA
- player has to continue doing same actions (job) while trying to do something else (playing game?)
- has to keep playing game to keep up energy to do job. money from job can be used on upgrades that help do job/play game better

- toy making factory - have to put parts in right place
- time limit for each toy, paid based on timeliness + accuracy
- hands move slower when more tired
- top ui: day#, time, money ðŸª™, energy âš¡, time left ðŸ•’
- left side: game, right side: work
- bottom right ui: faulty button
- will get bored of playing same game over and over?

MVP
implement ui + console battery
implement game console - what game?
- geometry dash
- frogger/crossy road
- flappy bird
put away/take out and switch game buttons, power button
implement energy mechanic - work decreases energy by X (measured by holding pieces) which increases over time, game increases energy by Y which decreases over time (measured by progression in game and game input)
lower energy will make hand move slower
even lower makes eyes blink
fired if energy reaches zero - fall asleep (include fired message)
implement end of day - show pieces built, loose parts, faulty pieces found, false faulty pieces, money made
implement shop
- games (if have time)
- upgrades + microtransactions
-- energy drink - decrease energy lost from work (one time)
-- coffee maker - decrease energy lost from work (perm, but less than energy drink)
-- hearty breakfast - increase starting energy (one time)
-- portable charger - increase battery life by 1 hours (perm, can be applied multiple times)
-- decrease game diff - make bar gaps wider (perm, can be applied multiple times)
-- flappy sticker - increase energy gained while gaming by a little

JAM VERSION
implement differences between days - use resources?
day 1 - 2 sec move, 10 sec work, starting energy high, gets lower over days
day 2 - 1.75 sec move, 7 sec work, introduce faulty parts
day 3 - 1.5 sec move, 5 sec work, increased faulty rate
day 4 - 1.25 sec move, 4 sec work, increased faulty rate, introduce outages if applicable
day 5 - 1 sec move, 3 sec work (implement boss)
day x - repeat but with gradually shorter work time
implement dialogue (starting dialogue, passing dialogue), dont start day until starting dialogue over
implement main menu
art
sound

EXTRA
implement more pieces
implement outages


DIALOGUE
BOSS: Alright, JACK, welcome to your first day at Amir Toys Inc.!
JACK: Right, so... how exactly does this work?
BOSS: Eh, you'll figure it out in no time. All you'll have to do is build some toys from bits and parts!
JACK: Well, that sounds pretty simple. How much am I getting paid again?
BOSS: You'll be paid based on your performance. The conveyor belt will move automatically, I'll be busy

TODO



- try not puzzle/platformer or level based (way to skip level)
- make difficulty choosable?
- strategy/diy/playerless/abstract/roguelike
- incorporate randomness into gameplay
